abstract = {The density operator for a quantum system in thermal equilibrium with its environment depends on Planck’s constant, as well as the temperature. At high temperatures, the Weyl representation, that is, the thermal Wigner function, becomes indistinguishable from the corresponding classical distribution in phase space, whereas the low temperature limit singles out the quantum ground state of the system’s Hamiltonian. In all regimes, thermal averages of arbitrary observables are evaluated by integrals, as if the thermal Wigner function were a classical distribution. The extension of the semiclassical approximation for quantum propagators to an imaginary thermal time, bridges the complex intervening region between the high and the low temperature limit. This leads to a simple quantum correction to the classical high temperature regime, irrespective of whether the motion is regular or chaotic. A variant of the full semiclassical approximation with a real thermal time, though in a doubled phase space, avoids any search for particular trajectories in the evaluation of thermal averages. The double Hamiltonian substitutes the stable minimum of the original system’s Hamiltonian by a saddle, which eliminates local periodic orbits from the stationary phase evaluation of the integrals for the partition function and thermal averages.}

abstract = {The position representation of the evolution operator in quantum mechanics is analogous to the generating function formalism of classical mechanics. Similarly, the Weyl representation is connected to new generating functions described by chords and centres in phase space. Both classical and quantal theories relie on the group of translations and reflections through a point in phase space. The composition of small time evolutions leads to new versions of the classical variational principle and to path integrals in quantum mechanics. The strong resemblance between the two theories allows a clear derivation of the semiclassical limit in which observables evolve classically in the Weyl representation. The restriction of the motion to the energy shell in classical mechanics is the basis for a full review of the semiclassical Wigner function and the theory of scars of periodic orbits. By embedding the theory of scars in a fully uniform approximation, it is shown that the region in which the scar contribution is oscillatory is separated from a decaying region by a caustic that touches the shell along the periodic orbit and widens quadratically within the energy shell.}

Our problems are about α the correspondence a ↔ a between physicial quantities a and quantum operators a (quantization) and β the possibility of understanding the statistical character of quantum mechanics by averaging over uniquely determined processes as in classical statistical mechanics (interpretation). α and β are closely connected. Their meaning depends on the notion of observability. We have tried to put these problems in a form which is fit for discussion. We could not bring them to an issue. (We are inclined to restrict the meaning of α to the trivial correspondence a → a (for lim ħ → 0) and to deny the possibility suggested in β). Meanwhile special attention has been paid to the measuring process (coupling, entanglement; ignoration, infringement; selection, measurement). For the sake of simplicity the discussion has been confined to elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics of scalar (spinless) systems with one linear degree of freedom without exchange. Exact mathematical rigour has not been aimed at.}
